# Intelligent Audiovisual Description for Accessibility of Visually Impaired People

A Flutter application using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to improve the accessibility of visually impaired people.

## Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent audiovisual solution to improve the accessibility of visually impaired people in Brazil. By leveraging the power of YOLO, an object detection algorithm, the Flutter application can identify and describe objects in real-time using the device's camera. The application provides audio feedback to users, allowing them to navigate their environment more effectively and independently.

## Key Features

- Real-time object detection: The YOLO algorithm is used to detect objects in the camera feed, providing instant feedback to the user.
- Audio description: The application generates audio descriptions of the detected objects, enabling users to understand their environment without relying solely on visual and physical cues.
- Customizable settings: Users can customize the audio feedback based on their preferences, such as the speed and volume of the descriptions.
- User-friendly interface: The Flutter framework ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience, making the application accessible to people with different levels of technical knowledge.
